<p style='margin-bottom:0'><b>Overall Ratings</b></p>

<p style='margin:0'>The Payne College Football Power Ratings use a composite of
two different systems, a Predict or margin of victory based system, and a W/L or Win/Loss
only system. The ratings in each system are computed independently, and then a
weighted average is used to combine the two ratings. The weighting adjusts throughout
the season from using a higher weight for the Predict at the beginning of the season
to a lower weight for the Predict by the end of the season. Since there is relatively
little data at the beginning of the season, considering the margins of victory is needed
to have sufficient data to make the ratings meaningful. By the end of the season, more data
is available and teams are more rewarded for their on-the-field record than on margins of
victory. Thus the overall ratings are the best system when determining how teams should be 
ranked based on actual game performance. To predict a game based on the Payne Ratings, 
the home team is predicted to win by its power rating plus the home field advantage minus 
the away team's power rating (if the result is negative, then the away team is
predicted to win by this margin).  The systems are defined in more detail below. </p>

<p style='margin-bottom:0'><b>W/L Ratings</b></p>

<p style='margin:0'>The W/L or Win/Loss ratings consider only the winner and
loser of each game played. No consideration is given to margin of victory, home
field advantage, or date the games are played. This system is completely BCS
compliant and correlates well with the other computer ranking systems. To
optimize the W/L ratings the computer determines the probability that the victor
of each game played matches the actual victor based on the current ratings. It
will then iterate the ratings until a maximum total probability is reached for
all games played to date. The probability function is based on the P-Win
concept described in more detail below. Note that for the first 4 weeks of the 
season (or whenever all teams become "connected"), other factors are considered
to create a unique solution for the W/L model.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:0'><b>Predict Ratings</b></p>

<p style='margin:0'>The Predict rankings use a predictive least
squares fit of previous games played. The model used considers several factors including
margin of victory, where the game is played, and when the game was played. It includes
all games involving at least one FBS school. This is the model that is used for
predicting all future games. Click on any team name from the main ratings
page, and you can see detailed predictions for that team for the regular
season.&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:0'><b>P-Win</b></p>

<p style='margin:0'>The <b>P-Win</b> column in the rankings and prediction page
is the probability that the team will win its next game. This assumes a normal
distribution of result errors and a standard deviation of 15.72. This normal
distribution matches well the college football data from the last several years.
The "<b>Visitor Win Prob</b>" on the "<b>All Predictions</b>" page uses a
similar assumption to compute probability. These probabilities are used for the final 
record prediction and the <b>Prob Undef</b> calculations defined below.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:0'><b>Final Records</b></p>

<p style='margin:0'>Two models are used to predict a team's final regular season
record on the individual team pages. The <b>probability model</b> uses the sum of the 
team's chance of
winning each game as its total wins for the regular season (and computes predicted
losses similarly). This is the model that is used on the main ratings page.
The <b>boolean model</b>, just looks at each matchup and
gives the team a win for each game that it is expected to win. The probability model
is a better predictor of final record. The <b>Prob Undef</b> column is the
computed probability that the team will finish the regular season undefeated.</p>
