Football Predictions</FONT></U></B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><A NAME="team"></A><B><U><FONT SIZE=+1>Team</FONT></U></B>
<BR>The team listed in the left most column is the higher ranked team (not
necessarily the favorate).

<P><A NAME="line"></A><B><U><FONT SIZE=+1>Line</FONT></U></B>
<BR>The national line(Line) that used here can be found at <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Arena/2460/odds.htm">http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Arena/2460/odds.htm</A>.
and may change through the week (after I retrieve it). If a different line
is desired simply compare the Wavg column with the different line to determine
the predicted winner. A negative line indicates that <A HREF="#team">Team</A>
is favored to beat <A HREF="#opponent">Opponent</A> by that many points.
A poisitive line indicates that <A HREF="#opponent">Opponent</A> is favored
to beat <A HREF="#team">Team</A> by that many points.

<P><A NAME="opponent"></A><B><U><FONT SIZE=+1>Opponent</FONT></U></B>
<BR>The team listed in the third column is the opponent of the <A HREF="#team">Team</A>
listed in the first column. This team is usually the underdog, but not
always.

<P><A NAME="actual"></A><B><U><FONT SIZE=+1>Actual</FONT></U></B>
<BR>This column is only present on the results pages. It is the actual
difference in the scores (<A HREF="#opponent">Opponent</A>'s score - <A HREF="#team">Team</A>'s
score)..

<P><A NAME="Wavg"></A><B><U><FONT SIZE=+1>Wavg</FONT></U></B>
<BR>This column is my predicted spread - the sign convention is the same
as <A HREF="#line">Line</A>. The weighted average(Wavg) is computed using
10 different prediction algorithms. The weights assigned to each algorithm
are based on the performance history of each algorithm so far this season,
with the most recent weeks being considered more that older weeks.

<P><A NAME="starpicks"></A><B><U><FONT SIZE=+1>Star Picks</FONT></U></B>
<BR>The algorithm to determine Star Picks varies from week to week, but
generally it is based on the standard deviation of the different prediction
algorithms, the difference between the weighted average(Wavg) and the national
line(Line), and/or the absolute value of the national line. One, two, and
three star picks are possible to this point, but I am considering expanding
that to include four and maybe even five star picks. Star picks are indicated
by *'s in front of the <A HREF="#pick">Pick</A>.

<P><A NAME="pick"></A><B><U><FONT SIZE=+1>Pick</FONT></U></B>
<BR>The pick is the team I predict to win <U>against the spread</U>. If
the <A HREF="#Wavg">Wavg</A> is less than <A HREF="#line">Line</A> this
will be <A HREF="#team">Team</A>, otherwise it will be <A HREF="#opponent">Opponent</A>.
On results pages correct picks are bold.
