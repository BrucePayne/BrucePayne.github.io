<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Composite Ratings</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Payne College Football Power Ratings use a composite of
two different systems, a MOV or margin of victory system, and a WL or Win/Loss
only system. The ratings in each system are computed independently, and then a
weighted average is used to combine the two ratings. The systems are defined in
more detail below. To predict a game based on the Power Ratings, the home team
is predicted to win by its power rating plus the home field advantage minus the
away team’s power rating (if the result is negative, then the away team is
predicted to win by this margin). Click on any team name from the main ratings
page, and you can see detailed predictions for that team for the regular
season.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>WL Ratings</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The WL or Win/Loss ratings consider only the winner and
loser of each game played. No consideration is given to margin of victory, home
field advantage, or date the games are played. This system is completely BCS
compliant and correlates well with the other computer ranking systems. To
optimize the WL ratings the computer determines the probability that the victor
of each game played matches the actual victor based on the current ratings. It
will then iterate the ratings until a maximum total probability is reached for
all games played to date. The probability function is based on the P-Win
concept described in more detail below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>MOV Ratings</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The MOV or margin of victory rankings use a predictive least
squares fit of previous games played. The model used considers margin of
victory (MOV), where the game played, and when the game was played. It includes
all games involving at least one FBS school.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By analyzing the score of each game played and minimizing
the sum of the square of the errors of the expected scores for these games
based on the power ratings, the computer iteratively adjusts the power ratings
and the home field advantage until an optimal point is reached.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The MOV model keeps up with all FBS schools and all schools
that play at least two games against FBS schools. The ratings from non-FBS
schools are not included in the posted list however. These schools ratings only
become meaningful to the FBS ratings when they play more than one FBS school,
allowing for meaningful relative comparisons to occur. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To achieve a unique solution during the first four weeks of
the season, the previous year’s games are considered very slightly. All of the
previous season’s games are considered to occur on January 1st of the current
year. The error squared term for each game is scaled by the following factor:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>MAX(0, 1-D/270)</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Where <i>D</i> is the number of days since the game was
played. Thus a game played when the rakings are computed is scaled by a full
100%, but a game 270 days or more ago is not considered at all. Therefore all
of the last year’s games are scaled down to zero after about the fourth week of
the season. Even at the start of the season they are considered only a small
amount relative to the current season’s games.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the first few weeks this method can lead to some
controversial results since it is weighed heavily on the relatively few games
played to that point in the current season. However I don’t think it wise to
weigh last year’s results very heavily. I’d rather not have to consider them it
all, but something is required to develop a unique solution before all teams
are “connected” to each other through games played. Keep in mind that many
rating systems do not even attempt to rate the teams early in the season for
this very reason. I believe it is still interesting to see how the teams rank
even if it is less meaningful than it will be later in the season.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>P-Win</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <b>P-Win</b> column in the rankings and prediction page
is the probability that the team will win its next game. This assumes a normal
distribution of result errors and a standard deviation of 15.72. This normal
distribution matches well the college football data from the last several years.
The “<b>Visitor Win Prob</b>” on the “<b>All Predictions</b>” page uses a
similar assumption to compute probability. These probabilities are included in
the <b>probability model</b> for the final record and the <b>Prob Undef</b>
calculations defined below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=FinalRecord>&nbsp;</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Final Records</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two models are used to predict a team’s final regular season
record. The <b>probability model</b> uses the sum of the team’s chance of
winning each game as its total wins for the regular season (and computes predicted
losses similarly). The <b>boolean model</b>, just looks at each matchup and
give the team a win for each that it is expected to win. The probability model
is a better predictor of final record. The <b>Prob Undef</b> column is the
computed probability that the team will finish the regular season undefeated.</p>
